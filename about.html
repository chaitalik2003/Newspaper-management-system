    <h2>Project Name</h2>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        Our Newspaper Management System is designed to streamline the distribution and management process between newspaper hawkers, customers, and administrators. This system ensures efficient delivery, customer subscription management, invoice generation, and record-keeping, all under one platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer Management:</strong> Allows customers to register, update their information, and manage subscriptions to various newspapers and magazines.</li>
        <li><strong>Hawker Management:</strong> Hawkers manage delivery routes, register/update profiles, and mark deliveries as complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Invoice Management:</strong> Generates invoices for customers based on the newspaper rates and days of delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Admin Panel:</strong> Admins monitor all operations and handle deliveries, invoices, and reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time Updates:</strong> Notifications about delivery statuses and invoices ensure transparency and efficiency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> PHP (with MySQL for database management)</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL (WAMP server for local development)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Customers can register and select their preferred newspapers and magazines. Hawkers manage delivery schedules and routes. Admins oversee all operations including managing customers, hawkers, generating invoices, and producing reports.
    </p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
        To create a user-friendly and efficient system that simplifies the management of newspaper distribution, customer subscriptions, and payment processing. The goal is to reduce manual workload and ensure transparency between all users.
